Learning programming is more fun with games!
Today, I created a **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using Python** where you can play against the computer.

**âœ¨ Key Features:**
âœ” User chooses rock, paper, or scissors
âœ” Computer picks randomly
âœ” Displays who wins or if itâ€™s a tie
âœ” Simple, interactive, and beginner-friendly

**ðŸ’¡ Why this project?**
Itâ€™s a great way to learn **loops, conditionals, and random module in Python** while making something fun!

ðŸŽ¥ **Watch the video to see the demo!**
What other beginner games do you think we should build next? Drop your ideas in the comments!
