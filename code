#Hello Everyone.  Today we learn about rock,paper scissors in the python program
#Lets see the program

#first import statement
import random

#Now create a whatever the chance have in the rock,paper scissor in a list
choices=["rock","paper","scissors"]
#Now create a user input statement
user=input()
#Now we whatever the chance to user use than]t taken by the choices

compare=random.choice(choices)

#Similarly Now Using condition statement If the user cheack compare it will execute you are equal score, elif the user give scissors compare to paper
#then user gine rock compare to scissors then user give paper to compare rock   or else print you are lose the game
if user == compare:
    print("You are Equal Score")
elif (user == "scissors" and compare =="paper") or (user == "rock" and compare == "scissors") or (user == "paper" and compare == "rock"):
      print("You are Win")
else:
    print("You lose the game")

    #Now run the Program
